Since there is no fixed time of conduction of these exams (UPSC, PSC) and these exams are conducted as per the availability of the vacancies, hence we follow AIAPGET duration, since it is conducted regularly every year. So, if you want to prepare for UPSC/PSC you can join the batches for AIAPGET. However, we may conduct online tests exclusively for the preparation of UPSC or State PSC, if and when there is an exam notification.</p>
